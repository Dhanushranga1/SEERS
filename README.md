# SEER: Secure & Efficient Entity Recognition System

SEER (**Secure & Efficient Entity Recognition System**) is an AI-powered cybersecurity platform designed to provide **real-time threat detection, access control management, and AI-powered insights** for security professionals. Initially built as a **hobby project**, SEER has evolved into a **feature-rich, next-gen cybersecurity dashboard** that leverages AI-driven analytics and real-time monitoring to enhance digital security.

## 🌟 **Why I Built SEER?**

As a cybersecurity enthusiast, I wanted to build a **powerful, AI-driven cybersecurity platform** that could:
- **Monitor real-time threats** through an interactive threat dashboard.
- **Enhance access control security** using **Identity & Access Management (IAM)** features.
- **Visualize cybersecurity threats** dynamically via an **interactive threat map**.
- **Leverage AI insights** to identify suspicious activities and prevent attacks.

SEER is my attempt at creating a **futuristic, AI-integrated security monitoring system** that could potentially scale for real-world cybersecurity needs.

## 🚀 **Current Features**
SEER has been built **step-by-step**, and here’s what’s currently implemented:

### 🔐 **Identity & Access Management (IAM)**
- **User Role Management:** Assign and update roles for users.
- **Permissions Management:** Control and manage security permissions for different roles.
- **Audit Logs:** Track changes in IAM settings to maintain accountability.

### 🛡️ **Threat Intelligence & Security Monitoring**
- **Threat Dashboard:** Displays total detected threats and active alerts.
- **Threat Logging:** Tracks security threats with severity levels.
- **Threat Statistics:** Shows real-time stats for detected cybersecurity threats.
- **Threat Resolution System:** Admins can mark threats as resolved.

### 🌍 **Live Threat Map**
- **Real-time Cyber Attack Visualization:** Uses **WebGL/Three.js** for an immersive cyber attack monitoring system.
- **Tracks sources of attacks dynamically** from various locations.

### 🤖 **AI-Powered Insights**
- **Threat Anomaly Detection:** AI analyzes and flags suspicious behavior.
- **Security Risk Scoring:** Provides risk levels based on attack trends.

## ⏳ **Upcoming Features (Work in Progress)**

### 🔥 **Advanced Cybersecurity Features** (Coming Soon)
- **Threat Alert System:** Alerts admins in real-time when a high-risk attack is detected.
- **Deeper AI-Powered Analytics:** More in-depth AI-driven cybersecurity insights.
- **Automated Threat Mitigation:** AI-based real-time threat response system.
- **Blockchain-Based Identity Verification:** Secure, decentralized access control.

### 🎨 **UI/UX Enhancements**
- **Even more immersive cyberpunk-inspired UI** (Mantine UI & Framer Motion animations).
- **Improved threat visualization tools.**

## 🎯 **Current Status**
SEER is currently functional and includes:
✅ IAM Role & Permission Management  
✅ Audit Logs for tracking user actions  
✅ Threat Dashboard & Monitoring System  
✅ AI-driven threat statistics  
✅ Live Cyber Threat Map  
✅ Real-time risk scoring & threat logging  

## 🌟 **Final Vision**
The **intended final product** is an **AI-powered cybersecurity intelligence system** that **continuously monitors threats, identifies risks, and mitigates security issues in real-time**. SEER aims to become a **self-learning cybersecurity assistant** capable of responding to security incidents dynamically.
